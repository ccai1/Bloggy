# Why we used passlib:
Link to documentation : https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
Passlib's function is to encrypt a password via hashing it and can be used to then decrypt it. We deemed it necessary on account of the issue of privacy. Within our code passlib encrypts the password that a user creates and decrypts it when a user is being verified.
